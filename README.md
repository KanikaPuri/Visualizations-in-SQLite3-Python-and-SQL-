The Chinook record store has just signed a deal with a new record label, and you've been tasked with selecting the first three albums that will be added to the store, from a list of four. All four albums are by artists that don't have any tracks in the store right now - we have the artist names, and the genre of music they produce:

Artist Name	Genre
Regal	Hip-Hop
Red Tone	Punk
Meteor and the Girls	Pop
Slim Jim Bites	Blues
The record label specializes in artists from the USA, and they have given Chinook some money to advertise the new albums in the USA, so we're interested in finding out which genres sell the best in the USA.

Write a query to find out which genres sell the most tracks in the USA, and then create a visualization of that data using pandas.
